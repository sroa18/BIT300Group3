# BIT300Group3
This is a repository created by Group 3 of the BIT300 / Development and Operations class to complete the 'Lab : Group Git' Assignment. 


Git is an Open Source Distributed Version Control System that tracks the history of changes as people and teams collaborate on projects together. A version control system is the foundation of a DevOps program and allows the management and tracking of system configuration and code changes. 

As a previous reading assignment I had you review the basics of Git on the following web page:

https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/Links to an external site.

In this lab you'll be creating a personal Git account and group 'coding' project.  A guide to help you with the steps can be found here... https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-git-and-how-to-use-it-c341b049ae61/Links to an external site.

(Note: 'coding' here means nothing more than several small text files. They don't need to be actual code.)

Using any real or virtual workstation, install git.
Each participant should create an account on the GitHub.com web site. 
(Push your scripts created in the Ansible lab up to your GitHub account.)
As a group, create a new project/repository on one of your local systems. (Create several small text files. The contents are relatively unimportant.)
As a group, stage and commit the project from the one system where it was created.
Each participant, check out the code from Git and work through several edits. Commit your changes.
Each participant, create a new branch, make several changes.  Commit and merge the branches. 
Verify that all changes are correctly merged, tracked and visible by all participants
